# Production Readiness Guide for Cohort Management Service

This document outlines the steps and considerations to make the Cohort Management Service production-ready.

## 1. Security Enhancements

### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement Spring Security for API authentication
- Add JWT or OAuth2 token-based authentication
- Configure role-based access control (RBAC) for different API endpoints
- Secure sensitive endpoints with appropriate authorization checks

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest in DynamoDB
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement AWS KMS for key management
- Add input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Sanitize all user inputs

### Secrets Management
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for storing credentials
- Remove hardcoded credentials from configuration files
- Implement credential rotation policies

## 2. Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Configure centralized logging with ELK stack or AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- Add appropriate log levels and contextual information
- Configure log retention policies

### Metrics
- Implement metrics collection with Prometheus or AWS CloudWatch Metrics
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs):
  - API response times
  - Error rates
  - SQS message processing rates
  - DynamoDB throughput and latency
  - JVM metrics (memory, CPU, garbage collection)

### Tracing
- Implement distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray or Jaeger
- Add trace IDs to logs for correlation
- Configure sampling rates for production traffic

### Alerting
- Set up alerts for critical service metrics
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Implement different severity levels for alerts
- Create runbooks for common alert scenarios

### Health Checks
- Add Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
- Implement custom health indicators for external dependencies
- Configure readiness and liveness probes for Kubernetes

## 3. Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Configure DynamoDB auto-scaling

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use DynamoDB DAX for read-heavy workloads
- Configure TTL for temporary data

### Application Optimization
- Tune JVM parameters for production workloads
- Configure connection pools for optimal performance
- Implement request throttling to prevent overload
- Use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Optimize batch sizes for SQS message processing

### Load Testing

## 6. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

### Circuit Breakers
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- Configure appropriate timeouts and retry policies
- Use fallback mechanisms for degraded functionality

### Rate Limiting
- Implement API rate limiting
- Configure appropriate limits based on client needs
- Provide clear rate limit headers in responses

### Retry Mechanisms
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Configure maximum retry attempts
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd problems

### Dead Letter Queues

- Implement monitoring and alerting for DLQ messages
- Create automated or manual reprocessing mechanisms

### Backup and Recovery
- Implement regular backups of DynamoDB tables
- Test recovery procedures
- Document RTO and RPO objectives

## 7. Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Configure auto-scaling for the application
- Use Kubernetes HPA or AWS Auto Scaling groups
- Define appropriate scaling metrics and thresholds

### Database Scaling
- Configure DynamoDB on-demand capacity mode
- Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Use global tables for multi-region deployments

### Statelessness
- Ensure application is stateless for horizontal scaling
- Use distributed caching for shared state
- Avoid local file system dependencies

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- Set up automated builds with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodeBuild
- Configure unit and integration tests
- Implement code quality checks
- Set up security scanning

### Continuous Deployment
- Implement blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Configure automated rollbacks
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Set up environment promotion workflows

### Artifact Management
